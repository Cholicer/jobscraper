A new Flutter project.

I uploaded this project just to show what I managed to do. Since this was my first experience in developing mobile applications, the written code turned out to be not very optimized. But my goal was to make a working application - which I successfully did. 

Now I want to redesign and improve this application using more appropriate tools.
